# UnderCooked
ENG1 Assessment 1 game made in LibGDX, based on the game Overcooked.

## Presentation:
Do check out our presentation: it is focussed on the ***key deciding aspects*** for ***choosing your Assessment 2 project***, as stated in the assessement brief:
> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NqWHm2E2ZyfIM41p6Bq1Ied1IFHrkFeQIG77mo2o_mg/edit#slide=id.g23b5b83aa1a_0_248

Aspects focussed on:
1) The overall quality of the software product.
2) Estimates of effort remaining to complete the implementation
3) Clarity and quality of the requirements specification, architecture and implementation.
4) Testability

There was a large focus on aspect 2 especially, meaning the presentation can likely form ***a rough guide to completing Assessment 2*** with our project.
